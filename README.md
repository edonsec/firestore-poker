# Firestore Poker

This tool can be used to probe an existing Firebase Firestore. Allowing testing for common security vulnerabilities, such as weak permissions.

## Installation:

The easiest way is to use Docker. 

* First copy the `dist/config.yaml.dist` to `./config.yaml`
* Configure the config.yaml with the respective Firestore details.
* Build and run the container with the following commands:

```
docker build -t firestore-poker .
docker run -it --rm firestore-poker
```

This should launch the interactive shell, looking like the following:

Alternatively, npm can be used to install the package. To get the latest NodeJS (16 recommended), use "n":

```
npm install -g n
n latest
npm install
```

## Usage:

To start with, copy the "config.yaml.dist" to "config.yaml" and replace the required values with the current target's respective values. These can often be located using static analysis against the application. 

Collections can be identified using dynamic requests, or otherwise searching the source for "collection". Language specific examples are shown below:

### Javascript:
```
collection(..., <Collection>...)
doc(..., <Collection>...)
```

### Java/Kotlin:
```
collection(<Collection>)
```

### Swift/Objective-C:
```
collection(<Collection>)
collectionWithPath:@"<Collection>"
```

## Usage

If installed, the following command should be available:

`firestore-poker`

If not, the application can be executed with the following:

`yarn start`

### Further Information:

* Collections are pluralised when used, therefore "user" will both check for "user" and "users". 
* Where file paths or spaces are present, strings should be encasulated within quotes.
